### Design Process
When I first started the project, I knew I wanted to draw something that the chess master, John Bartholomew, and his YouTube fans would appreciate and identify with. I knew I didn't want to create some generic chess illustrations (cause anyone can do that). Rather, I wanted to include little details in the art that his fans can look at and say, *"That is so John!"*, or *"That is so #TeamScandi!"*.

### Background + Brainstorming
I started with the following themes:
- **Scandinavian Defense:** It is well-known among John's fans that he loves playing the [Scandinavian Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_Defense). So much so, that his fans call themselves *Team Scandi*.
- **Fins:** John's online handle on various online chess sites, and on Twitter, is *Fins*.
- **Starbucks:** John a vocal fan of Starbucks. He would frequently tout it on cam.

Armed with **Scandinavia + Fins + Starbucks**, I started brainstorming and sketching out ideas.

The Scandinavian Defense is a chess opening that involves two pawns standing diagonally from each other in the centre of the chess board, so I sketched designs with diagionally positioned squares and pawns. Incidentally, Scandinavian is also a type of design, so I played around with Scandinavian design motifs as well.

I wanted to see if I can also do a play on the word *"fins"* and include shark- and/or water-themed design elements as well.

### Putting it all together

Here's the final product from Illustrator.

Some additional details I included when working with it on Illustrator:
- **Arrows + circles:** These are quite common in chess videos. John, and other chess YouTubers, commonly use circles to highlight a piece, and arrows to indicate potential moves.
- **Bullet icon:** Bullet chess is chess played with REALLY fast time controls (i.e. each side only has 1 minute to make all their moves). Bullet chess videos are on regular rotation on John's channel, and are some of his most entertaining videos due to the speed at which chess is played.
- **Berserk icon:** "Berserking" is a feature on popular chess website, lichess.org, where a player takes a risk by choosing to cut their available move time in half in order to gain an extra point if they win the game. John does this frequently in his videos, and it's heart-attack-inducing.

I was pretty happy with the outcome, received a lot of positive feedback from him and his fans. Here it is in action:

I've also created assets for use on dark themes.
