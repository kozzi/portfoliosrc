## Designer | Developer | Product Manager

Hi, I'm Charing!

I design user experiences, and I make them real with code. I â™¥ the entire process of creation. I am my happiest when I am surrounded by really smart people and learning something new.

## Designer
I am a self-taught UX designer and illustrator.

I love the end-to-end process of designing and building consumer-facing products. To me, user experience design is not just about pretty visuals (although that can help!). Design should always be about solving user problems. 

## Developer
I graduated from the [Software Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/software-engineering/) Co-op program at the [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca) (at the top 10% of my class with [Dean's Honours List](https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/ENG-Deans-Honours-List)) . My degree, and its excellent co-op program, taught me solid CS fundamentals. I understand what well-designed, maintainable, and scalable software looks like.

My engineering background not only lets me communicate effectively with developers, it also gives me the ability to build the product myself, which I love! I am not afraid to dig into a codebase to build features and fix bugs, and I take pride knowing I can do those things properly.

## Product Manager
For several years, I worked in Seattle as product manager at [Microsoft](http://microsoft.com), where I was responsible for designing and shipping large user-facing products (like, for *billions* of users). 

I understand what it takes to collaborate with a team of developers, testers, designers, user researchers, and marketing to ship something. I understand what it means to advocate for our users. I understand storytelling is a big part of shipping. I understand prioritization. I understand that, sometimes, you have to make difficult tradeoffs.

## What I am looking for
My ideal role is where I am always learning new things. I care about advancing my skills in all three of the areas above. I am always more interested in the kind of work I do, than the title I carry.

I currently have a slight preference for roles with more design work, because that feels like an area where I have most to learn :) If you are looking for someone who is *relentless* about learning new things, and need somebody who prides herself in being a Jill of all trades, let's chat!

## In my spare time...
... I love climbing, cycling, practicing calligraphy, and (watching) chess. 

I also love teaching. I was a climbing instructor and trip organizer for [Washington Alpine Club](http://washingtonalpineclub.org)'s basic and intermediate climbing classes for 3 years. If you live in the GTA and are into easy/moderate multi-pitch trad climbs, I'm always looking for new partners :)

I enjoy giving time back to promoting computer science education. In the past, I've volunteered as mentor and instructor with organizations like [Ladies Learning Code](http://ladieslearningcode.com), [Kids Learning Code](http://kidslearningcode.com) and [DigiGirlz](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/diversity/programs/digigirlz/default.aspx). I also regularly build features and fix bugs for [Code.org](http://code.org).
