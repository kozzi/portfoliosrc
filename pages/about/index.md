## Designer
I am a self-taught UX designer and illustrator.

I first started building websites at the age of 13, when I was part of an online community of young female web designers &mdash; and it was what all the cool girls did :) I wanted my website to look *spectacular*, which set me off learning everything I could about HTML, CSS, and Photoshop.

To this day, I still love the entire process of designing and building products. It's incredibly rewarding to see the delight in your users because of something you've made.

## Developer
I hold a bachelor's degree from the [Software Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/software-engineering/) Co-op program at the [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca), where I graduated at the top 10% of my class with [Dean's Honours List](https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/ENG-Deans-Honours-List). My degree, and its wonderful co-op program, taught me solid CS fundamentals. I understand what well-designed, maintainable, and scalable software looks like.

My engineering background not only helps me communicate effectively with developers, it also lets me build the product myself, which I love! I am not afraid to dig into a codebase to ship features and fix bugs, and I take pride knowing I can do those things properly.

## Product Manager
For several years, I worked in Seattle as user experience PM at [Microsoft](http://microsoft.com), where I was responsible for designing and shipping features in large user-facing products.

I understand what it takes to collaborate with a team of developers, testers, designers, user researchers, and marketing to ship something. I understand what it means to advocate for our users. I understand prioritization. I understand that, sometimes, you have to make difficult tradeoffs. I understand storytelling is a big part of shipping.

## What excites me!
In one word: Learning!

I love learning new things, and improving my skills in all three areas above. It sounds incredibly cliche, but I like dipping my toes in a little bit of everything. You can see evidence of this in my work :)

If you are looking for someone who is *relentless* about learning new things, let's [chat](/contact) over <strike>coffee</strike> bubble tea!

## In my spare time...
... I love climbing, cycling, practicing calligraphy, and (watching) chess. 

I also love teaching. I was a climbing instructor and trip organizer for [Washington Alpine Club](http://washingtonalpineclub.org)'s basic and intermediate climbing classes for 3 years. \[*Sidenote: If you live in the GTA and are into easy/moderate multi-pitch trad climbs, I'm always looking for new partners :)* \]

I enjoy giving time back to promoting computer science education. In the past, I've volunteered as mentor and lead instructor at organizations like [Ladies Learning Code](http://ladieslearningcode.com), [Kids Learning Code](http://kidslearningcode.com) and [DigiGirlz](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/diversity/programs/digigirlz/default.aspx). I also regularly build features and fix bugs for [Code.org](http://code.org).
